# HTML Canvas Particles
 
 This repository contains code that draws beautiful particles and lines with HTML canvas on mouse move.
 You can view the live site [here](https://mbonamensa.github.io/particles-on-mousemove/) and play around with it :)

I learned how to build this by following a tutorial by [Frank's Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvz_axxWG4Y)
